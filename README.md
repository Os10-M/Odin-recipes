# Odin-recipes
Basic recipe website for the Odin project

In this project I have created a new repository, used : git clone ssh_id : to import the repository from github to my local directory. 

I have created a README file and have updated it with this submission in order to explain the point of this project and showcase the skills I have learned so far in the Odin Project. 

Then adding the updated Readme file using git add , git commit -m "Add file_name."

  <h1>Brownie</h1>
   
    <p>This recipe is one that I tinkered with while working as a chef, it is my personal favorite. The brownies are moist, dense, and superbly chocolaty.</p> 
    <p> This recipe will fill an 8x8 pan for an inch and a half thick brownie. Pending on serving size you could have 1 generous brownie or 9 modest brownies :)</p>

      <li>1/4 tsp Kosher salt</li>

  <h3>Step by Step:</h3>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Preheat</strong> oven to 350 degrees</li>
      <li><strong>Melt</strong> the butter: <em>either in the microwave or by double-boiling</em></li>
      <li><strong>Combine:</strong> the flour, cocoa, salt in a large bowl</li>
      <li><strong>Mix</strong> melted butter, sugar, vanilla, and eggs together in another bowl</li>
      <li><strong>Add</strong> the flour mixture into the butter mixture and mix vigorously</li>
      <li><strong><em>Add</strong> in the walnuts, candies, etc.. if applicable</em></li>
      <li><strong>Spray</strong> non-stick oil onto 8x8 pan - <em>Or use coconut oil/crisco etc..</em></li>
      <li><strong>Spread</strong> some flour and coat the greased pan, then tap out the excess into the trash bin</li>
      <li><strong>Finally,</strong> transfer the brownie mix to the pan and bake for 20-30 minutes. The fragrance will be overwhelmingly charming.</li>
      <li><strong>Use a toothpick</strong> to check if they're done by inserting it into the center of the brownies. They're done when the toothpick comes back clean.</li>
      <li><strong>Allow to cool,</strong> cut into preferred serving sizes, and <strong>Enjoy!</strong></li>
